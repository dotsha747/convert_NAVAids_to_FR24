These are the scripts referenced in my blog post 
http://blog.shahada.abubakar.net/post/flightradar24s-premium-radar-view-adding-airways-navaids-and-fixes.

They can be used to convert NAVAID data from an X-Plane Installation / Navigraph subscription into a format suitable
for use by FlightRadar24's radar mode. 

I've moved the scripts to github as a number of people were having problems accessing them on my own git server.
