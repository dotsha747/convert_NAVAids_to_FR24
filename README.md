These are the scripts referenced in my blog post 
http://blog.shahada.abubakar.net/post/flightradar24-s-premium-radar-view-adding-airways-navaids-and-fixes. Please read through the blog post and comments for further details.

They can be used to convert NAVAID data from an X-Plane Installation / Navigraph subscription into a format suitable
for use by FlightRadar24's radar mode. 

I've moved the scripts to github as a number of people were having problems accessing them on my own git server.

Please note that this is to add airways and waypoints to flightradar24's "Radar Mode", which you will get when you have a FligthRadar24 Silver (and above) account.  If you just want navaids on the regular Flight Radar screen, you can enable that under Settings -> Map -> Aeronautical Charts (for Gold and higher account holders).
